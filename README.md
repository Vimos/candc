# C&C Parser

The Java C&C parser is a port of the [C&C parser](http://svn.ask.it.usyd.edu.au/trac/candc) originally written in C++ by James Curran and Stephen Clark.

This repository contains a development version of the Java C&C parser for my Computer Science Tripos [Part II (2014-2015)](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/projects/) and [Part III (2015-2016)](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/masters/projects/) projects.

The official version of the Java C&C parser can be obtained from Stephen Clark [here](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sc609/java-candc.html). This development version will be merged with those of other projects and released after the projects are completed.
